# Summary: Guide to Selecting Player Roles and Duties in Football Manager

This guide provides an in-depth approach to choosing player roles and duties in Football Manager, emphasizing the interconnectedness of player choices and tactical instructions across all areas of the team. Here’s a concise summary of each section:

---

## General Principles

- **Roles and Duties Interconnected:** Every player's role affects others; for example, a striker's duty is influenced by the midfield and wide players, and vice versa.
- **Team Cohesion:** Selecting roles and duties cannot be done in isolation; always consider the overall system and balance.

---

## Goalkeepers

- **Distribution:** Options include rolling, throwing, short kicks, and long kicks. Choose based on your defensive setup and style (e.g., short for possession, long for direct/pressed situations).
- **Sweeper Keeper vs. Traditional GK:** Sweeper Keeper suits high defensive lines and counter-attacks; traditional GK is more conservative and fits deeper lines.
- **Key Decisions:** Decide how you want your GK to distribute the ball and what "sweeping" you require based on your defensive line and offside trap.

## Central Defenders

- **Roles:** Central Defender, Limited Defender, Ball Playing Defender.
- **Duties:** Defend (standard), Stopper (steps out), Cover (drops back).
- **Pairings:** Generally, don't pair two Stoppers or two Covers; mix for balance. Ball Playing Defender usually works best paired with a Central Defender.
- **Back 3 Setups:** Consider how wide defenders cover space. Use Defend/Stopper/Cover combinations or a Sweeper/Libero as needed.
- **Half Back:** Sits in front of the defense but drops deeper when out of possession, forming a back 3.

## Central Midfielders

- **Key Area:** Central midfield governs both attack and defense.
- **Pairs:** Typically have a "sitter" (defense-oriented) and a "runner" (support/attack-oriented).
- **Trios:** Add an "attacker" for more offensive thrust. Use a mix of defend, support, and attack duties for balance.
- **Quadrants (4 midfielders):** Use diamond or box shapes for numerical dominance; balance defensive and offensive roles.
- **General Rule:** Defensive cover is the first priority, especially in midfield pairs; creativity and attacking runs can come from flanks.

## Wide Players

- **Lone Wide Men:** Must provide both width and defensive cover. Use roles like Full Back (Attack), Wing Back (Support/Attack), Wide Midfielder (Support), Defensive Winger (Support).
- **Dual Wide Men:** Offers more tactical flexibility and partnerships (e.g., overlapping fullbacks with wingers).
- **Balance:** Make sure wide players complement each other rather than crowd the same space.

---

## Striker Partnerships

- **Big Man–Little Man:** Target Man with Poacher or Advanced Forward, relying on direct supply and wide delivery.
- **Creator–Scorer:** Deep-Lying Forward/Complete Forward as creator, Advanced Forward/Poacher as scorer; suits possession and creative systems.
- **False Nine–False Ten:** Forward drops deep (False Nine), AM or Shadow Striker attacks the space vacated; suits possession and intricate play.
- **General Advice:** Split duties for good movement, provide multiple attacking routes, and support from AMs and midfielders.

## Team Instructions

- **Philosophy:** Rigid = specialists; Fluid = universal team roles.
- **Possession:** Short passing for possession, direct for fast transitions. Adjust crossing and through-ball instructions based on players and opposition.
- **Penetration & Shape:** Exploit central or wide areas based on team strengths; use overlap and shape instructions for space creation.
- **Defensive Strategies:** Adjust defensive line, pressing, tackling, and marking based on team shape and opposition threats.
- **Tempo & Risk:** Match passing style with tempo (short = lower tempo, direct = higher tempo). Allow more creativity for expressive teams or discipline for structured play.

## Building a Team

- **Start with Philosophy & Style:** Decide how you want to play based on team strengths, expectations, and depth.
- **Formation Selection:** Choose formations that suit your philosophy and best players.
- **Roles & Duties Allocation:** Build defense first, then midfield, then attack. Use a balanced mix of defend, support, and attack duties.
- **Player Instructions:** Minimal changes; if you need many instructions for a player, reconsider their role.

---

## In-Match Adjustments

- **Formation Flexibility:** Have alternate shapes for different situations.
- **Instruction Tweaks:** Adjust instructions for game state—e.g., more direct passing on counter, more possession when defending a lead.
- **Player Roles:** Make small, situational changes to roles/duties as needed during matches.

---

## Playing Styles

- **Possession:** Lower mentality, shorter passing, press to win back possession. Avoid Target Man.
- **Direct:** Rapid transitions, direct passing, use of Target Man, Winger, etc. Avoid playmaker roles that slow play.

---

## Final Thoughts
